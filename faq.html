  <h2>.... CodeClub?</h2>
  <p>CodeClub is a weekly gathering of people interested in coding and (web)development. I realized I'm not the only one who's interested in the subject, and this could be a fun way to explore the subject in a group of like-minded peeps! Who knows, you might make new friends :D</p>

  <h2>So where just going to be doing homework for 2 hours?</h2>
  <p>Nope! We're starting each week with a small workshop on a specific and useful subject in web-dev world. Think "How to use Git and GitHub" or "How to animate things on the web". After the workshop—and based on time / attendee input—we'll reserve some time to do a code critique. If you have a project you're working on which you'd like (technical) feedback on, or you've made super awesome to show us, this is your chance!

  </p>

  <h2>So eh, who's behind this?</h2>
  <p>CodeClub is being organized for students by students. For now, I (<a href="https://github.com/rijkvanzanten">Rijk</a>) am pulling the organization, but if you like to help out, please reach out! (rijkvanzanten@me.com)</p>

  <h2>Why do I need to RSVP?!</h2>
  <p>I have absolutely no idea how many people are interested in this or how many people will show up. For now, we have room 404 to use, but if 50 people show up, we have a problem. By RSVPing beforehand, I can make sure we have a room big enough for all of us :-)</p>

  <h2>Do I need to be a JavaScript Wizard, HTML Lord, or CSS Queen in order to join?</h2>
  <p>Absolutely not! We're all trying to learn more about the <em>Wonderful World of WebDev.</em>We'll decide on the workshop topics together as a group to make sure the subjects fit as many peoples skills and interests!</p>

  <h2>Aight, cool, cool, now what?</h2>
